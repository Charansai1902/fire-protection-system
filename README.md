# 🔥 Automatic Wildlife Protection and Forest Monitoring System

A real-time Arduino + NodeMCU based solution to detect forest fires early and guide wildlife to safety using sensor data and alert systems.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Forest fires are a major threat to both wildlife and the environment. Animals often struggle to escape in time due to the rapid spread of fire and lack of alerts. Existing fire detection systems are either expensive or slow to respond.

## ✅ Our Goal

To create an **affordable, real-time forest monitoring system** that can:
- 🔍 Detect early signs of forest fires
- 🦌 Guide animals to nearby shelters using LED signals
- 🚨 Alert forest security teams for rapid response

## 🔧 Components Used

| Component              | Purpose                                           |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno / NodeMCU  | Main controller                                   |
| DHT11 Sensor           | Detects temperature and humidity                  |
| LEDs                   | Provides a lighted path to safe zones             |
| Jumper Wires & Breadboard | Used to connect all components                |

## 💡 How It Works

1. The DHT11 continuously monitors **temperature and humidity**.
2. If a **high-temperature and low-humidity condition** is detected:
   - A **signal turns ON the LEDs** to guide animals.
   - The system can be extended to **send alerts via Wi-Fi or SMS**.
3. The system resets automatically when conditions normalize.

## 📈 Results

- ✅ Built a working prototype that accurately detects abnormal conditions
- ✅ Triggered alert signals (LEDs) in real-time
- ✅ Recognized by university with a **Certificate of Merit**

---

## 🧠 Future Scope

- Add a **GSM or Wi-Fi module** for real-time alerting
- Use **solar power** to run in remote areas
- Build an **app dashboard** for forest officers
